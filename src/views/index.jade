                        p Cam and JoJo met at ThoughtWorks in Bangalore, India in 2006; Cam from the Sydney Office and JoJo from London.
                        p After spending two months exploring India and getting to know one another, they decided (after Cam consulting his mum!) to give long-distance a go. The next six months were a blur of early morning skyping sessions, texting, emailing and surprise snail mail. 
                        p They had no idea when they would next be able to see each other, and shortly after JoJo booked a (non-refundable) flight to visit Cam in Sept, TW offered her a three month assignment in Aus starting in Oct! She jumped at the chance, and packed up her life to set off on a new adventure.
                        p Three months turned into three and a half years, and the pair decided to return to the UK to work from the London office for a couple of years. Here they met more lovely, life-long friends, explored Europe’s pubs and realised that their poor livers would never be the same again.
                        p All too soon the London Assignment was over and they moved back to Manly to live close to the beach. In April 2013, Cammy got down on one knee and proposed to JoJo in a photobooth, which he had lovingly hand-decorated.

                        p Many of our friends have beautiful children and we would love for them to join us for the Ceremony/ Drinks & Canapes. We hope to hold it outside (weather permitting) so there should be plenty of space for them to move and play.
                        p For the evening dinner celebrations we plan to hold an adult-only event. This is due to limited space, but also allows all guests an evening of relaxation, without having to worry about little eyes and ears. We hope that this advance notice means that you are still able to share our big day with us. 
                        p Our wedding planner has organised many childfree receptions, working with a properly vetted nanny agency called SillyBillies. They are an English speaking agency, whose staff have all been Police checked and ID verified.
                        p We understand that some guests may feel uncomfortable about leaving their little one, so we totally understand that this may not work for you.
                        p Please let us know if plan on bringing the littles and would like to make use of this service so we can give you all the relevant details. We can also pass on owner’s details so that you can talk to her directly to set your mind at ease.

We truly believe that your presence at our celebration is a beautiful gift for us to treasure and so, no others are needed, Thank You.
                        p For those who insist on giving something- Please send or email us a photograph, once you get home, of yourselves enjoying France in all it’s beautiful cheese and wine glory, so that we have a beautiful memento of our special people. :)
